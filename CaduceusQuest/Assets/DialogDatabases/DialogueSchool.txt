	[2](s)Bea(e)a,2(t)"Taurus, what does going home feel like these days? Think about whether you growing toward or away from your family.">13;
	[3](s)Bea(e)a,2(t)"Gemini, you are powerful but you can't do this alone. Think about who your friends, family, and accomplices are right now.">13;

	[11](s)Bea(e)a,2(t)"Aquarius, no one wants to be told that what formed them is something they must escape. Think about your definition of success today.">13;
	[12](s)Bea(e)a,3(t)"Pisces! My favorite. You will find something green at the Hospital if you look at the plants.">13;
	[13](s)Bea(e)a,2(t)"Do you want to hear another one?"<1;
